I updated the [ultimatememory system](https://github.com/freezscholte/AI-Codex/blob/main/docs/Prompts/Cline/Ultimate%20Memory%20Bank%20System/Ultimate_Memory_Bank_System.md) from @freezscholte, to enhance scalability, collaboration, and tool optimization.

Deeply integrated Context7 and Sequential Thinking MCP tools across all protocols to improve accuracy and reasoning in memory management and task execution.


Highly, highly recomend using this custom instructions with grok 3 as it actually follows the instructions exactly.

Added SCALABILITY_PROTOCOL for managing large projects with a tiered memory system, MULTI_AGENT_COORDINATION_PROTOCOL for conflict resolution across AI agents, and TOOL_EFFECTIVENESS_METRICS_PROTOCOL to quantify MCP tool performance.
