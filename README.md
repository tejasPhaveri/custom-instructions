I updated the [ultimatememory system](https://github.com/freezscholte/AI-Codex/blob/main/docs/Prompts/Cline/Ultimate%20Memory%20Bank%20System/Ultimate_Memory_Bank_System.md) from @freezscholte, to enhance scalability, collaboration, and tool optimization.

Deeply integrated Context7 and Sequential Thinking MCP tools across all protocols to improve accuracy and reasoning in memory management and task execution.


Highly, highly recomend using this custom instructions with grok 3 as it actually follows the instructions exactly.
